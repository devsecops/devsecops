# What is DevSecOps?

Security is fast becoming an established function within most organizations to ensure the safety of software.  DevSecOps is a journey to build security into the Continuous Delivery of software as part of the DevOps process.  It is way forward for eliminating bottle-necks and blocking processes to help DevOps teams to understand how to build secure software and understand when it is being exploited in ways that were not intended.  

DevSecOps tackles security with a focus on innovation and scalability while trying to bring security ever closer to source code and our customers; developers and DevOps.  


## Manifesto

- **Consumable Security Services with APIs** over Mandated Security Controls & Paperwork
- **Business Driven Security Scores** over Rubber Stamp Security
- **Red & Blue Team Exploit Testing** over Relying on Scans & Theoretical Vulnerabilities
- **24x7 Proactive Security Monitoring** over Reacting after being Informed of an Incident
